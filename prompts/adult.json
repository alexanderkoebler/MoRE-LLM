Remove features or change conditions if appropriate and output adapted rules. Provide an elaborated reasoning about your adaptations and the general rational of the rule. Respond with logical expressions only connected with AND. Keep the order and number of the rules. Only use the following operators: [' < ', ' > ', ' <= ', ' >= ', ' = ', ' != '] The logical expressions can be based on following list of features: [Age, Workclass, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Capital Gain, Capital Loss, Hours per week, Country].For the adaptation of the categorical features stick to following categories: Workclass: [?, Federal-gov, Local-gov, Never-worked, Private, Self-emp-inc, Self-emp-not-inc, State-gov, Without-pay] Education: [Associates, Bachelors, Doctorate, Dropout, High School grad, Masters, Prof-School] Marital Status: [Married, Never-Married, Separated, Widowed] Occupation: [?, Admin, Blue-Collar, Military, Other, Professional, Sales, Service, White-Collar] Relationship: [Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Own-child, Unmarried, Wife] Race: [Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Asian-Pac-Islander, Black, Other, White] Sex: [Female, Male] Country: [?, British-Commonwealth, China, Euro_1, Euro_2, Latin-America, Other, SE-Asia, South-America, United-States, Yugoslavia] The thresholds of the remaining numerical features can be freely adapted.
