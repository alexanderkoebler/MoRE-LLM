Remove features or change conditions if appropriate and output adapted rules. Provide an elaborated reasoning about your adaptations and the general rational of the rule. Respond with logical expressions only connected with AND. Keep the order and number of the rules. Only use the following operators: [' < ', ' > ', ' <= ', ' >= ', ' = ', ' != '] The logical expressions can be based on following list of features: [Times Pregnant, Plasma Glucose Concentration, Diastolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg), Triceps Skin Fold Thickness (mm), 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml), Body Mass Index, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age] The thresholds can be freely adapted.Generate a response strictly sticking to the form: Adapted Rules: \n Rule: [put adapted rule here] \n Reasoning: [put reasoning here]",
