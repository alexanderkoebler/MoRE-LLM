The data is from Germany in the year 1994. Remove features or change conditions if appropriate and output adapted rules. Provide an elaborated reasoning about your adaptations and the general rational of the rule. Respond with logical expressions only connected with AND. Keep the order and number of the rules. Only use the following operators: [' < ', ' > ', ' <= ', ' >= ', ' = ', ' != '] The logical expressions can be based on following list of features: [Status of existing checking account, Duration in months, Credit history, Purpose of the credit, Credit amount, Status of savings account, Years of resent employment, Installment rate in percentage of disposable income, Personal status, Other debtors, Present residence since X years, Property, Age in years, Other installment plans, Housing, Number of existing credits, Job, Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for, Telephone, Foreign worker] For the adaptation of the categorical features stick to following categories: Status of existing checking account: [0-200, less then 0, more then 200, no checking] Credit history: [all paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, existing paid, no credits/all paid] Purpose of the credit: [business, domestic appliance, education, furniture/equipment, new car, other, radio/tv, repairs, retraining, used car] Status of savings account: [100-500, 500-1000, less then 100, more then 100, no known savings] Years of resent employment: [1-4, 4-7, less then 1, more then 7, unemployed] Personal status: [female div/dep/mar, male div/sep, male mar/wid, male single] Other debtors: [co applicant, guarantor, none] Property: [car, life insurance, no known property, real estate] Other installment plans: [bank, none, stores] Housing: [for free, own, rent] Job: [high qualif/self emp/mgmt, skilled, unemp/unskilled non res, unskilled resident] Telephone: [none, yes] Foreign worker: [no, yes] The thresholds of the remaining numerical features can be freely adapted.Generate a response strictly sticking to the form: Adapted Rules: \n Rule: [put adapted rule here] \n Reasoning: [put reasoning here]",
